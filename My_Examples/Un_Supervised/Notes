## what is Un supervised

- Unsupervised learning models are utilized for three main tasksâ€”clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction.

## Clustering
- Clustering is a data mining technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. 
- Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information. 
- Clustering algorithms can be categorized into a few types, specifically exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic.

## Association Rules
- An association rule is a rule-based method for finding relationships between variables in a given dataset. 
- These methods are frequently used for market basket analysis, allowing companies to better understand relationships between different products.
